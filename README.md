3. In your README.md file, describe - in a few sentences - what we've covered in lesson 3.
In Chapter-3 we learn about coding basic encryption and decryption methods. how to make it function. Additionally, we learned about different forms of Ciphers including; Transposition Cipher, Substitution Cipher, and The Vignère Cipher. 

5. List and describe 3 basic string methods.
astring.center(w) - returns the string astring surrounded by spaces to make astring w characters long.
astring.count(item) - Returns the number of occurrences of item in astring.
astring.lower() - Returns astring in all lowercase.

6. Describe the 3 simple algorithms for encryption that we covered in this lesson 
Transposition Cipher - a method of encryption by which the positions held by units of plaintext are shifted according to a regular system.
Substitution Cipher - a method of encrypting by which units of plaintext are replaced with ciphertext.
The Vignère Cipher - a better Substitution Cipher.

7. Identify the type of encryption the following algorithm is implementing:
Transposition Cipher

4. Identify the type of encryption the following algorith is implementing:
The Vignère Cipher
